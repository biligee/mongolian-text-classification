Mongolian text classifier in tensorflow.

# STEPS

- Run spider in order to collect corpuses and labels from ikon.mn 
    > scrapy runspider ikon_mn_scrape.py

- Download corpus from here, let's respect ikon.mn, scraping can be troubling. 
    > https://drive.google.com/file/d/14NvUkqZRapivmiWc2WOOwIEu9UWyYnnJ/view?usp=sharing

- Create word2vec from all files inside 'corpuses' directory
    > python3 clear_create_word2vec.py 

- Convert word2vec file to ids matrix as a numpy file format in order to use with tensorflow
    > python3 numpy_embedding_matrix_tf.py

- Use embedding matrix with tensorflow in eager mode
    > python3 convert_text_to_seqvector_through_embedmatrix.py

- Prepare training and testing dataset
    > python3 prepare_trainingset.py

- Train lstm recurrent neural network for news classification
    > python3 training_bilstm_rnn.py
    
    > python3 training_lstm_rnn.py

- Freeze trained checkpoints to servable tf model, iteration number is depends on your trained result, see models/bilstm folder after training
    > python3 freeze_tf_model.py --name lstm --iteration 1000

    > python3 freeze_tf_model.py --name bilstm --iteration 3000

- Start classifier RPC server
    > python3 use_freezed_model_rpc.py 

- Start Django to see web interface
    > cd djangoapp

    > python manage.py runserver


# DONE
- Write some scrapers for ikon.mn
- Prepare training texts with its labels, label should be a type of news. For example: politics, economy, society, health, world, technology etc
- Train lstm classifier, also other ones like bibirectional lstm
- Try to classify text from other sites, for example: news.gogo.mn, write some web backend interface, maybe I can use django 2.0
- Implement testing dataset evaluation metrics

# IN PROGRESS

# TODO
- Use transfer learning techniques such like ULMFiT, ELMo embedding etc... and compare results
- Implement stacked lstm
- Implement stacked bidirectional lstm
- Implement stacked bidirectional lstm with dropouts
- Implement previous ones with batch normalization
- Compare testing performances
- Handle very long text through Truncated BPTT
- Handle gradient vanishing issue with gradient clipping
- Add attention to the lstms
- Use an IndRNN and compare the results to previous ones
